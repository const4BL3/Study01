# Simple TDD Practice
This is not an in depth study of TDD, but perhaps more will be added along the way

## Requirements

- Build an app that can count
- Given an input argument of a number, build an app that will count up from 1 to the number by displaying the current count value, the current count number of times separated by spaces on each line.
- Do not allow the program to fail if a number is not passed as an argument.
- There should be a Main method that accepts an array of string arguments. It should call the MakeAllLines method.
- Assure that no more than one argument is passed to the program.
- There should be a MakeALine method that accepts an int and returns a string.
- There should be a MakeAllLines method that accepts an int and returns a string. It should call the MakeALine method.
